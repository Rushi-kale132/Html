                        You read that correctly. It was a Palm Pilot app called MentorMate (hence our name!) that helped students
                        learn foreign languages. Taking everything we learned while developing our own product, we began bringing
                        other entrepreneursâ€™ software ideas to life. Since then, hundreds of companies the world over have trusted
                        us to guide their vision, design innovative products, and deliver secure solutions.
